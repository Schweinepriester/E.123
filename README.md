# ITU E.123 Public service announcement

**TL;DR**:  
This is _the_ correct way to write telephone numbers:
+22 607 123 4567

## Context

Akin to [xkcd 1179: ISO 8601](https://xkcd.com/1179/) about proper date format ([entry on explain xkcd](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1179:_ISO_8601)), this is promoting the [ITU E.123](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.123) international notation for telephone numbers.

## Why?

Because it's a notation that always works, no matter the constellation.

Skipping over [national conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_conventions_for_writing_telephone_numbers&oldid=1287294480), [different national trunk prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trunk_prefix&oldid=1288774700#Countries_using_national_trunk_prefixes) (or [not](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trunk_prefix&oldid=1288774700#Countries_that_no_longer_use_a_national_trunk_prefix)), [remembering when to dial what](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trunk_prefix&oldid=1288774700#Example) and lastly [international call prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_international_call_prefixes&oldid=1307819193):

> These prefixes are typically required only when dialling from a [landline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landline "Landline"), while in [GSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM "GSM")-compliant mobile phone (cell phone) systems, the symbol *+* before the destination country code may be used irrespective of the location of the telephone when dialing. The network operator provides the access codes automatically.
